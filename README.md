# Day 6

There are separate branches for Segment 1 and Segment 2 in this repository. Both segments include two things:

1) Coding exercises

2) Written/Multiple Choice questions

The reason for two separate branches for two segments is to have separate test suites run on travis CI.

### Instructions:

1) Clone this repo using
  ```
    git clone <link to repo>
  ```

2) Change directory
  ```
    cd <Folder Name>
  ```

3) Install dependencies
  ```
    yarn
  ```

4) To do the exercises in branch `segment-1`
  ```
    git checkout -b segment-1
    git pull origin segment-1
  ```

5) Do your work and then push to the branch
  ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "your commit message"
    git push origin segment-1
  ```
